## My Process

### Built With

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **PDF Generation**: pdfMake library
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS utilities

### Features Added on the top of the challenge

- Secure login and registration feature, enhancing user-specific invoice management.
- PDF invoice downloads using the pdfMake library.
- Backend implementation for managing user accounts and invoices with MongoDB.

### What I Learned

This project helped solidify my understanding of full-stack development, especially:

- Building modular, standalone components in Angular.
- Managing data flow between frontend and backend using RESTful APIs.
- Implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Integrating third-party libraries like pdfMake for advanced functionalities.

#### Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example of generating a PDF using pdfMake:

```typescript
const generatePDF = (invoice: Invoice) => {
  const documentDefinition = {
    content: [
      { text: `Invoice #${invoice.id}`, style: "header" },
      { text: `Amount: ${invoice.amount}`, style: "subheader" },
    ],
  };
  pdfMake.createPdf(documentDefinition).download(`invoice_${invoice.id}.pdf`);
};
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Integrate OAuth for third-party login options.
- Optimise PDF creation with company logo.

### Useful Resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs): Essential for understanding Angular concepts.
- [pdfMake Documentation](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.1/): For generating PDFs dynamically.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A fantastic utility-first CSS framework.
